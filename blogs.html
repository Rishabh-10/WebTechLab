               <br> <br><strong>App Development Process</strong>
                Project architecture. We do initial business analytics and create the architecture of the future product.
                Wireframes. We create black & white mockups of your screens that will show the flow of the app and its main functions.
                Design & Prototyping. We create a design style, apply it to the product and create your first prototype of the future product.
                Development. We turn our designed prototype into the final product that your users will love.
                <br>
                <br><strong>1)</strong>Project Architecture:
                As with building a house, when working on a software project laying the proper foundation is essential. In the Project Architecture stage, we conduct business research to understand the industry and your target audience better. Thereafter, we will work on creating an optimal use flow to ensure that your users get to their goal in as few taps as possible.
                
               <br><strong>Main parts of this stage:</strong>
                
                <br>We start by onboarding you to the project and connecting to tools that will be used throughout the project.
                <br>By using App Business Canvas we will conduct business research to understand the needs of your core market.
                <br>At this stage, we will create User Story Flow Charts that will show how our users will move through the product.
               <br> In the end, we will analyze your core market-style preferences to prepare for the next stage.
        
               <br> <br><strong>2)</strong> To build a house on top of your foundation you need floorplans to know what should go where. That’s what wireframes do for digital products. In this stage, we will create black & white mockups of the entire application and plan the layout of each screen. This will be the first visual representation of the product.
                
                <br><strong>Main parts of this stage:</strong>
                
               <br>First, we select the main user stories that will represent the main functionality of the product.
                <br>While wireframing main user stories, we optimize our user experience for speed and quality.
                <br>After the main user stories are complete we apply their UX elements to other screens.
                <br>Before moving to design we review the final wireframes to make sure no screen or function is missing.
                <br>App Design Examples
                <br>Design & Prototyping
               
                <br><br><strong>3)</strong> While we are working on prototyping the main user stories, we will also begin our design process. After discussing your design preferences with you and researching the industry, we will present you with a style that we think works best. After that, we’ll work with you to make sure your feedback is applied so that we create a design that will wow you and your target audience.
                
               <br><strong>Main parts of this stage:</strong>
                
                <br>We start by creating wireframes that will represent a black & white outline of all screens.
                <br>By analyzing yours and your target market preferences we will prepare a unique design style for the product.
                <br>With our design ready we will build our first interactive prototype that you can test on your phone.
                <br>With our design ready we will build our first interactive prototype that you can test on your phone.
                <br>Development Stage
               <br> Development
                
               <br><br><strong>4)</strong> The development stage starts with a team meeting after which we’ll assign developers to specific tasks and prepare an updated timeline. After an initial couple of weeks of coding, you can expect to see a new build every week. As a result, you’ll be able to constantly monitor the progress on your own device where you will be able to see/test new features as they appear.
                
               <br><strong>Main parts of this stage:</strong>
                
                <br>During the development process, you will receive regular builds that you can test on your phone.
               <br>Our development process undergoes several stages of testing to make sure the final product has no bugs.
                <br>During this stage, we start to combine features and ideas for the next big app update after the launch.
               <br> At the end of the development, we will help you submit the app to App Store and Google Play and make sure it gets approved.

            <h1 class="blog-heading">CLOUD COMPUTING</h1>
            <article class="blog-text">
                <strong>What is Cloud Computing?</strong><br><br>

                Cloud computing is heavily used in the corporate environment nowadays for following reasons: <br>
                <br>Security concern associated with data
                Concern regarding dependency on services which are controlled by third parties
                Some organizations will become leaders in the charge while other will lag from the others.
                The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) define Cloud Computing as <br><br>
                
                “A model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.”<br><br>
                
               <br> <strong>Certification in Cloud & Devops</strong>
                
               <br> In simple words, it demands running computer/network applications that are present at some other place on other people’s servers with the use of a simple user interface or application format. Still confused?  In layman terms cloud computing can be understood as using other people’s servers for running applications for your own organization remotely.
                It is believed that presently, most people are making use of cloud computing. It varies in the way they use the cloud, but everyone is using the cloud. Cloud computing provides plethora of business opportunities to the entrepreneurial businesses in following way:
                
               <br><br> <strong>Cost reduction by leveraging cloud computing environment by providing infrastructure and services.</strong>
                Bringing an expanded portfolio of products at a reduced cost to access large complex infrastructure;
                Expanding services quickly and economically.

              <br> <br> <strong>Cloud computing environment is based on service models which can be categorized into three basic service models which are as follow –</strong>
                
               <br> Infrastructure-as–a-Service (IaaS)
                
               <br> Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
                
               <br> Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
                
                IaaS	It provides access to fundamental resources which include physical machines, virtual machines, virtual storage, etc.
                PaaS	It provides the runtime environment for applications,  tools for development and deployment, etc.
                SaaS	This model allows end-users to use software applications as a service.

                <br><br> <strong>Cloud computing also faces some challenges such as</strong>
                <br>
                Security and Privacy of organization information
                Portability of data
                Computing Performance
                Reliability and Availability of services provided by third-party.
                Two newer module which are added in order to enhance cloud computing technique are
                
                Identity-as–a-Service (IDaaS).
                Network-as-a-Service
                Managed AWS and other cloud services is also available by brands having certified cloud engineers.
                
                Conclusion
                As the cloud market is still a new technique and major players such as IBM and HP have yet not arrived in full force thus for many organizations in the short term the apparent potential of the cloud might not be sufficient to make the transition to cloud computing. But when we talk about the longer term, cloud computing is increasingly appearing to be a major change in the business landscape. Also the cost benefits of cloud computing services has started gaining acceptance in today’s economy where organizations are highly focused towards addressing financial challenges.

            <h1 class="blog-heading" id="webDev">WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1>
            <article class="blog-text">
                <br>It’s not easy to stay productive as a developer. It’s a mentally stressful job that can quickly exhaust the mind and also requires a lot of attention. Understanding how you can focus on your work, take shortcuts using automation, and deal with distractions can help you a lot in making the most out of your working hours. In this collection, you can find our best productivity tips for developers and programmers, from finding the best developer tools to taking regular breaks to successfully eliminating distractions while working.

               <br> <br><strong>1. FIND THE BEST CODE EDITOR</strong>
                Developer productivity starts with a good source code editor. Although there are many great options in the market, it’s hard to tell which is the best one — it all depends on your goals and needs. It’s worth trying out different code editors to see which one fits best with your workflow. Here are some important things to take into consideration…
                
               <br> <br>Which programming language(s) you are using. You need a code editor that offers syntax highlighting for the languages you need (at least as a plugin). Some code editors also come with syntax highlighters for popular technologies such as React, not only for programming languages.
                <br>If your chosen code editor has an adequate theme and plugin ecosystem that provides the functionality you need (for instance, a high contrast theme if you have low vision).
                <br>If you commit your work to a code sharing platform, such as GitHub or Bitbucket, you might find built-in Git functionality useful. For instance, Visual Studio Code lets you directly commit your work to GitHub without leaving the editor.
                <br>If you want to use your own code snippets and/or keyboard shortcuts, it’s also a good idea to pick a code editor that lets you add or import them.
               <br> <br><strong>2. START WITH THE MOST DIFFICULT TASK EVERY DAY</strong>
                <br>It’s easy to get lost in daily tasks and procrastination is also a common habit of developers — especially, if you work as a freelancer and have to manage your own deadlines. Therefore, it frequently happens that you work all day and by the end of the day, you realize that you have barely accomplished anything. You can avoid that if, rather than multitasking, you create a hierarchy of daily tasks and start with the most difficult task every day.
                
               <br> <br>Although multitasking had been seen as a positive thing for many years, it turned out that it’s not suitable for most people. Research has shown that only 2% of the population are good at multitasking, while the rest can suffer a loss of productivity as high as 40%. So, if you are in the 2% keep going on with multitasking, otherwise prioritize your tasks and focus only on one thing at the same time.
                
               <br> <br><strong>3. TAKE BREAKS REGULARLY</strong>
                Humans can’t concentrate on the same thing for unlimited time and this is especially true of hard mental work such as programming. You can find different studies about the time limit people can focus on a task without their mind wandering off to something else. For example, this study states that sustained attention is possible for about 45 minutes, while another one mentions 52 consecutive minutes followed by a 17-minute break.
                
               <br> <br>Then, we have the famous Pomodoro Technique that uses a tomato-shaped kitchen timer to measure time. It works with 25-minute time blocks with 5-minute short breaks and 10-minute long breaks. The Pomodoro Technique has become so popular with the developer community that there are even Pomodoro apps you can use while working.
                
                <br>All in all, there’s no golden rule here, and everyone has a different time limit, so you’ll need to experiment a bit to find out what works best for you. It’s also not worth following a very strict rule — if you are already in the flow, don’t interrupt your work just because the time for the break has arrived.
                
                <br>However, there’s one important thing to remember. The break has to be a real break when you do get up from your desk. Checking emails, Slack notifications, social media, blogs, or just staring at any kind of screen won’t matter as a break for your brain — every single research on the subject states this as a fact.
                
              <br>  <br><strong>4. SCHEDULE YOUR TASKS IN ADVANCE</strong>
                Scheduling your tasks in advance can also significantly increase your productivity. You can either create task lists and check off completed tasks using to-do apps such as Wunderlist and Todoist, or set up workflows with an app such as Trello. These days, there are also many great options that allow you to integrate different productivity tools, such as Zapier and IFTTT (If This Then That).
                
                <br>With task scheduling, you’ll also need to conduct some experiments and think about what kind of tools you’ll really need. You can use more than one apps for managing tasks for sure, however, there’s also a risk of using too many tools at the same time. In some cases, too much complexity can even lead to a loss of productivity.
                
              <br>  <br><strong>5. TRACK YOUR WORKING HOURS</strong>
                Although not everyone likes to track their working hours, putting a time tracking app into use can help a lot if you have problems with time management. Time tracking can increase your productivity mostly because you can see how you spent your time during the day so that you can screen out possible distractions. Time trackers can also be a godsend if you are a freelancer, as they help you bill your clients on an hourly basis.
                
              <br> <br> <strong>6. AUTOMATE REPETITIVE TASKS</strong>
                Automating repetitive tasks is a must these days as a developer. It’s not a coincidence that DevOps (the intersection of Development and Operations) is all the rage recently, as it’s all about automation. You won’t need much automation in the development phase, however, making your development code ready for production does involve a lot of repetitive tasks.
                
                <br>For instance, as a frontend developer, you can use a task runner to automatically perform routine tasks on your code, such as minification, image optimization, auto-prefixing, and others. We have a recent article on the best build tools for frontend developers, but there are also many great options for backend programming that are worth checking out.
                
               <br> <br><strong>7. USE THE COMMAND LINE</strong>
                Besides automating tasks, it’s also a good idea to make a habit of using the command line in your everyday workflow. First, you can significantly speed up your workflow if you use a CLI (Command Line Interface) instead of a GUI (Graphical User Interface). For instance, here’s a tutorial about how to set up the WordPress CLI to speed up WordPress development and maintenance. Second, securely using CLI commands is an important programming skill that you can use in many other areas of your work.
                
               <br> <br><strong>8. ELIMINATE DISTRACTIONS</strong>
                Distractions are the biggest enemy of productivity, so you need to find a way to eliminate them as much as possible. Unfortunately, they have a sneaky nature, so it’s not easy at all to catch them. This is mainly because many times, they don’t seem like a distraction first.
                
                <br>For instance, checking your email every hour, watching a new video tutorial on YouTube, or chatting with colleagues on Slack can be seen as work-related tasks, but if you are spending too much time on them, you might find that you haven’t accomplished that much by the end of the day.
                
                <br>So, you need to be very careful about distractions and take precautions wherever you can. For example, you can decide to check your emails only twice a day, switch off Slack notifications while working, or block distracting websites that you frequently visit during work.
                
               <br> <br><strong>CONCLUSION</strong>
                If you follow our productivity tips or at least some of them, you can use your working hours more efficiently and also improve your development workflow at the same time. Although picking up a new habit can be hard at first, it quickly becomes second nature.
                
                Remember that experimentation is the key thing about productivity. If you try out a technique or tool that doesn’t work for you, ditch it, and move on to the next one, until you find the one that best fits with your workflow and personality.<br>

            <h1 class="blog-heading" id="dataSci">DATA SCIENCE</h1>
            <article class="blog-text">
                <br>This blog post will provide you with a comprehensive data science roadmap that can aid your learning, helping you succeed in a world loaded with data.


                <br>First & foremost, you need to motivate yourself to love the data, with no drive you will probably leave your learning journey at some point. Moving on, you need to practically work on real projects. Just acquiring the fundamental skills won’t make you an expert, likewise, to increase your expertise, it is significant for you to increase the level of difficulty every time you undertake a data science project. While being at work or internship, learn from your peers & subordinates, check how they are executing the data science projects. Last but not the least, present your insights & analysis to others.  
                
                <br>But you might be wondering what skills do you exactly require for being a successful data scientist & how, to begin with, those? What steps do you need to follow to take a leap into the field of data science?  
                
                <br><br>Before we get started with the actual data science roadmap, which of the following expertise/skills do you have/possess within the domain of data science?
                
                
                
                <br><br> Since now you have a know-how of what skills you already possess, the below data science roadmap can help you understand where you do stand & what extent of efforts are needed for you to reach the endpoint. 
                Image showing a standard roadmap for data scientists, including valuable resources.
                
                <br><br><strong>Step1</strong>: Getting Started 
                Before you move on to learning & adapting to new skills, it is important for you to understand what data science is & if you are a great fit for data science or not.
                
               <br> <br>This article by innoarchitech precisely explains what data science is, it further enlightens on the roles of data scientists, data engineers, and data analysts that can surely help you in deciding which boat to jump in.  
                
                <br>To further assess, check what type of data scientist you are with the below short quiz: 
                
                
                <br><strong>Step2</strong>: Learn the basics of mathematics & statistics  
                <br>The next checkpoint in the data science roadmap is to learn the fundamentals of mathematics & statistics. These topics should be your area of focus: 
                
               <br> <br>Descriptive Statistics 
                Probability  
                Inferential Statistics  
                Linear Algebra 
                Structured Thinking  
                
                
                
               <br> <br><strong>Step 3</strong>: Acquainting the Key Tools for Data Science 
                <br>1. Python: It is one of the most popular & widely used programming languages. Learning this language can help you with creating web applications, handling big data, rapid prototyping, and much more. To know more about python, check this introductory blog post for it.  
                
                <br>Learn all the fundamentals of Python for Data Science with our upcoming training! 
                
                <br>2. R: Another popular language for programming in R. It provides a free software environment for statistical computing. These few blog posts can definitely add value to your knowledge of R programming:  
                
               <br> <br>Logistics Regression in R  
                <br>R language programming for Excel Users 
               <br> Natural language Processing with R programming books
                <br>You might be stuck with the same traditional argument between R Versus Python; if you are wondering which one of them you should opt for, then I did suggest you begin with R and transition to Python gradually. Then use them as per the needs of your organization.   
                
               <br> <br>3. Data Exploration & Visualization: If you are into the analytical side of the data i.e. data analysis then you must learn data exploration & visualization.
